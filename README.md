<h2>Todo List with Weather API Panel</h2>

Welcome to my profile!<br>
I would like to present my first serious application.<br>
Work on this App is still ongoing, so I hope it will get even better in the near future.<br>
Enjoy it!<br><br>

Im use simple API from https://www.metaweather.com so you can find only the biggest towns (most often capitals).<br><br>
Also I'm use here:<br>
1. React<br>
2. Javascript<br>
3. SCSS<br>
4. Context API<br>
5. Hooks<br>
6. Axios<br>
7. Day.js<br>
8. I'm working with RWD & optimization.<br>
